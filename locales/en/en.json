It combines camera, sensor, and motion data in real time to accurately calculate each wagon’s weight without human intervention. AI algorithms analyze wagon shape, speed, movement trajectory, and contact points, delivering accuracy far superior to traditional methods. Each measurement is automatically recorded and sent to a central database for monitoring, auditing, or cargo control.",
      "camera": "Wagon Vision is an advanced AI-driven system that fully automates wagon number recognition in railway logistics. Camera streams are processed in real time, and the AI model accurately reads numbers on both moving and stationary wagons, converting them into a digital format. Even under challenging lighting conditions, dirty surfaces, or partially visible numbers, the system ensures high accuracy through deep learning algorithms.",
      "helmet": "Kaska Vision is an intelligent safety monitoring system that automatically verifies employee compliance with safety requirements in industrial, construction, and railway environments. AI analyzes video streams in real time to detect helmets, protective glasses, uniforms, reflective vests, and other safety equipment worn by workers. It identifies employees in motion or standing still and evaluates whether safety rules are properly followed.",
      "chat": "The Railway AI Chat Bot fully automates access to railway-related information and provides users with accurate, fast, and reliable responses in real time. The system analyzes data on railway infrastructure, stations, routes, schedules, freight regulations, safety protocols, and technical standards to generate precise answers to user queries."
